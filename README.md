### Thermal Performance
Safety and efficiency are paramount. We took a thermal image of the board under these testing conditions to ensure that all components remained within safe temperature limits. The results were impressive: the entire board stayed cool, with the warmest component being the ESP32 microcontroller, which only reached around 40°C.

## Firmware development

If you want to modify the functionality of the Spark Analyzer or contribute to it's firmware development process, you can follow the steps below.

* clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/tooyipjee/Spark-Analyzer.git`
* install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/setup/setup-overview)
* install the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) plugin in VSCode
* open the project you want to use: [WebApp for Power Delivery](https://github.com/tooyipjee/Spark-Analyzer/tree/master/PlatformIO/WebApp) or [WebApp for Programmable Power Supply](https://github.com/tooyipjee/Spark-Analyzer/tree/master/PlatformIO/WebApp_PPS)
* connect the Spark Analyzer with a usb-C to usb-C cable to your computer
* open the "Monitor" task in PlatformIO
  * you may have to configure the serial port in `platformio.ini` file, e.g.
  ```
    upload_port = /dev/ttyACM0
    monitor_port = /dev/ttyACM0
  ```
* make sure you see the boot messages
* perform the "Build" task to build the firmware
* then perform the "Upload" task to flash the new firmware
* once the flashing is complete, perform "Build Filesystem Image" and "Upload Filesystem Image" tasks

### Debugging

* in the Platform IO "Monitor" you can follow the debug output from the Spark Analyzer
* if you have a serial UART adapter you can also
  * connect to the GND, RX, TX pins to the Spark Analyzer and
  * change the `UART` marcro in `main.cpp` to use `Serial0`
  * then you can see some debug output via this second UART

## Web development

* The web app is served from the data/index.html file
* You can follow the requests and responses exchanged between the web app and the firmware by opening your browser's "Web Development Tools".
